# Overview

This is a basic calculator. The formula class (which does the bulk of the calculations)
is from a school project where we created a spreadsheet program. I was tasked with
implementing the class based on the professor's specifications, but the bulk of the code
in that class is my own. I did not implement the regex in the formula class. The remaining
classes in this project are 100% my own work.

# Functionality

This calculator functions in essentially the same way as the standard Microsoft calculator,
except mine has buttons for parentheses instead of the % and CE keys on Microsoft's 
calculator.

Every button has a corresponding keyboard key. Most of them work, but I haven't figured out
how to get event handling to work with a shift key, yet.

# To Run

Open project solution in Visual Studio and run from there.
